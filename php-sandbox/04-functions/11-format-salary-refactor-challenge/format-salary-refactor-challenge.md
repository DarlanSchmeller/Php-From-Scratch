# Format Salary Lambda Refactor

In this lesson, I want you to do a couple things in the job listings page that we have been working with.

1. Refactor the `formatSalary` function to an arrow function
2. Since this is no longer a named function, it will be a variable. You need to change the name in the two places that it is called.
3. One of the calls is in another function. Since it's a variable, it will no longer be available in the scope of the function it's called in. Think **callback**.
