<!-- # Average Salary Challenge

In this challenge, I want you to create a function that will calculate the average salary of the salaries in the job listings.


It will take in the entire `$jobListings` array. You will need to loop through the array and add up all of the salaries. Then you will need to divide that total by the number of salaries. Finally, you will need to return the average salary.

#### Hints

- You can use the `count` function to get the number of items in an array.
- You can either use the `array_sum` function in combination with `array_column` to add up the salaries or loop over the `$jobListings` array using a `foreach` loop and add up the salaries using the `+=` operator.
- Use the `formatSalary` function that we created to format the average salary. -->
